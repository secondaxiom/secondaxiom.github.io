<p>
The method of exhaustion is a technique invented in Ancient Greece to calculate areas of curvilinear plane figures by way of successive approximation, using a sequence of inscribed, or circumscribed, polygons. 
</p>

<p>
Antiphon of Athens was the first to apply the method of exhaustion to the calculation of the area of a circle. His method was further developed by Bryson of Heraclea and, later, Eudoxus of Cnidus, the latter of whom formalized Antiphon and Bryson's method into a rigorous procedure. Euclid drew upon Eudoxus in book XII of the <em>Elements</em>, supplying proofs of the formulae for the volume of a sphere, cylinder, cone and tetrahedron. This technique prefigured the development of integral calculus in the 17th century.

<p>
One of the most well-known applications of the method of exhaustion is due to Archimedes, who used the technique to calculate the area under a parabolic segment.
</p>

<p>
Archimedes' proof can be outlined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
1 Build a sequence of inscribed polygons \(P_n\);

<li>
2 Sum the series \(P_n\) and show that sum of each successive \(P_{n+1}\) adds to \(\frac {1}{4}\) the area of the previous sum;

<li>
3 Show that \(P_n\) reduces to a geometric series that converges to the area of the figure;

<li>
4 Reducto ad absurdum: area must be exactly \(\frac{4}{3} P_1\), nothing else is possible.

</ul>
<p>
See the following for a detailed derivation of the above result:
